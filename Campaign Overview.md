# Shards of Stories

**Why the name?** The name has no actual meaning to the campaign, it was just a placeholder name that hasn't been changed. I picked it because of my DMing storytelling style which inevitably looks like an anthology series of quests. 

### The Player Cast

* **Aythian Zyexstendurmonis.** A ravenite dragonborn of some importance in his clan, traveling the land with the goal of eradicating what remains of the draconblood bloodline. While very singleminded in his activities, Aythian has proven to be receptive to his party member's council.

* **Caelic.** A wanderer who has seen much of Wildemount in his years, Caelic is rather closed off from those around him. Only through threat of sword did he even care to mention he was a twin. Despite odd sleeping habits and a potential drug addiction, Caelic is the levelheaded one of the party.

* **Corrow (Departed).** Plague doctor by trade, a goth by description, Corrow was a key figure in the early decision making for the party. His order's oath to eradicate a deadly plague is what initially united the party with a common goal, but when events dramatically changed that goal, Corrow departed to continue his work. 

* **Hildi.** As lovable as she is intimidating, Hildi believes herself to be a powerful sorcerer capable of casting magic. While the party has yet to see her perform any feats of magic, her personality is magical in its own right. She is prone to chasing frogs, and is currently magically bound to Merethyl for a duration of one month.

* **Merethyl.** Hailing from a far off land, Merethyl seeks adventure in Wildemount. The exact reason why she is here isn't particularly clear, but since arriving she's already been directly responsible for the death of a merchant and summary exile from Palma Flora. Armed with a mysterious sword that actively harms any who try to discern information from it, Merethyl is the current unwilling master of Hildi, bound for a duration of one month.

* **Trisha.** A cheerful member of this traveling party, Trisha appears to have some kind of background in magic, providing suggestions and observations about some of the more interesting magical phenomenon the party has encountered. Armed with a pair of swords, and several more in her pack, the agile swordswoman is a valuable member of the party.
